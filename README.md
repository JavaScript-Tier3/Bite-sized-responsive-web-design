## Overview of HTML and CSS
- HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is used to establish the raw page structure for web pages. This is what will make up the headings, tables, images, paragraphs, and so on. Essentially everything that appears on the page will need to be contained in an HTML element. 

- CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is used to apply formatting and design to the raw HTML. This will be font, colors, layout positioning, animations, and so on. CSS is what will make the web page look more appealing, and can be how you add in accessibility features to the web page. 

## HTML Elements
- block-level elements will always need to be on their own line in the HTML code.

- inline elements will be on the same line as other block-level and inline elements.

## CSS Features
- Rules:
    selector { property: value; }
